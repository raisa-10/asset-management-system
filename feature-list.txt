ASSET TRACKER – FEATURE LIST

1. Understanding of Client Requirements

The client wants a software system for managing company assets.
The primary goal is to track which asset is currently assigned to which employee.
The system should help the company maintain visibility over assets such as laptops,
mobiles, ID cards, accessories, or any other company-owned items.

The software should reduce confusion, prevent asset loss, and improve accountability
by maintaining a clear record of asset ownership and assignment history.


2. Creative Freedoms Taken

- Product Name: "Asset Tracker"
- Scope: Focused on basic asset tracking and employee assignment for the first version.
- Platform Assumption: Web-based application accessible via browser.
- User Roles: Assumed presence of an admin user to manage assets and employees.
- UI Simplicity: Simple and minimal interface over complex visual design.
- Versioning: Treated this as Version 1 (MVP) with essential features only.


3. Assumptions Made

- Each asset has a unique identifier (Asset ID).
- Each employee has a unique employee ID.
- Only authorized users (admins) can assign or unassign assets.
- One asset can be assigned to only one employee at a time.
- The client is not requesting hardware integration (e.g., RFID) at this stage.
- Internet access is available since the system is web-based.
- Data volume is manageable for a basic database setup.
